 <h2 align="center"> Hi there, I'm Théo 👋 <br><br> <p align="center"> I'm an iOS Developer 💻, a full stack development student 👨‍🎓 and soon Android Developer 🤖</p> </h2> 
 
For me, creating an application is like playing a video game, I think it's even more entertaining.  I've done all my apps on my own, and I've gone through all the phases of a project, from the idea to the deployment on the AppStore, including design, feature research, development and so on.

## 💻 I'm currently working on
- 📊 My bigger project called "CashFlow Tracker"
- 📚 A project at school named "Ocerall"

## 🌱 I'm currently learning
- ✨ SwiftUI Animations
- 📱 UI/UX Design
